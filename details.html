                    plugins, to test front-end, back-end, and RESTful APIs. o
                    Utilized Cucumber, Selenium, REST Assured, and numerous best
                    practices, including configurability, reusability of
                    components, object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, Java

                <p>
                  This is complete online pizzeria where user can view menu,
                  create orders with add-ons (except paying of course). User can
                  observe order status in-live and many more. I completed this
                  project in 3 weeks. The UI/UX design, frontend and backend,
                  html, css etc are completely mine work whereas chat GPT really
                  helped me to select colors, fonts and name.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Innovative thing in this project is an agent that understands
                  voice and add pizzas to a cart.

                  There were 60 pages of requirements regarding UI that were
                  implemented in 3 weeks, and I am proud of the result.
                  Minimalistic design, blue and white colors patterns and live
