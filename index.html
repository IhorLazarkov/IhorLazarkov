            I still can tell you a little bit about me. My passion is coding and
            design. And Full-stack Web development is the place where I can
            implement my ideas. I enjoy to write software as elegant piece of
            code. With my strong background in testing I realy believe I can
            make a difference in software engineering and deliver reliable
            software that clients can enjoy!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am in software engineering since 2006. Although I started as Test
            Engineer my pasion for coding was alive and I tried to make use of
            it in every oportunity. Thus, I vivedly remeber when I was testing
            desktop app for Windows platform I came accros an issue when
            standard 'save as' dialog was somewhat broken. I addressed it, but
            it was not accepted by development team as issue. So I took Win32
            API and generated the dialog and prooved my point. From that moment
            my career as Automation Test Engineer has started.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated in 2006 as master of Computer System and Networs. My
            diploma was about optimization of computer software, that works with
            graphics, by using C/C++ with assembler. Oh, yeah... I wrote
            programes on assembler: protocol RS-232, card games and something
            else I don't remember already, but those two were main output.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still pursue my dream to become Full-stack Software Engineer and
            for that reason I am undergoing Post Secondary graduation in

            for employed students for entire year. I see how people from
            different non-computer background are struggling and not-giving up
            make me feel so proude of them!
